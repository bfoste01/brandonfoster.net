My name is **Brandon Foster**. You probably figured that out from the name of the website. I am a PhD student at the [Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study and Human Development](http://ase.tufts.edu/epcd/) at **Tufts University**. I obtained a Master's Degree in *Child Study and Human Development* from the same department in 2013, and obtained a B.A. in *Psychology* from the [University of Southern Maine](http://usm.maine.edu). Finally, I had a fun stint studying *Jazz Composition* at [Berklee College of Music](http://www.berklee.edu) and the [University Maine at Augusta](http://www.uma.edu/jazz.html).

I have many research interests. Most of these interests can be categorized as follows:

- The achievement gap (why it persists, how to close it, etc.).
- Risk and protective factors for academic achievement in early-childhood.
- [Approaches to Learning](http://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/hslc/tta-system/teaching/eecd/Domains%20of%20Child%20Development/Approaches%20to%20Learning/edudev_art_00017_061705.html).
- Community coalitions as a mechanism for community-change initiatives.
- The intersection of the open source movement and community-specific data initiatives (e.g., [Chicago's Open City](http://opencityapps.org) is a great example of these types of initiatives).
- Integrated data systems as a mechanism for community change initiatives.
- Leveraging big data (i.e. **Twitter**) as a research tool for forming new indicators of child and family well-being, understanding civic engagement, and community change initiatives.
