#Becoming a Data Scientist Part 1: Entry Into the Kaggle Universe
*(The estimated reading time for this article is 2 minutes)*

I've decided to enter into some [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competitions this year. Kaggle is a platform for data scientists to compete in predictive analytic challenges. Some of these competitions pay out cash prizes, and some of these prizes are quite sizable, other competitions pay nothing. 

I'm not in it for the money. Realistically, there are a lot of pros gunning for those prizes. I'd like to get to that level at some point, but for now this experience is about me applying some of the machine learning techniques I've been emersed in to datasets. I hope that my involvemnt in the challenges help me:

- Have a focused and finite outlet for the machine learning techniques I have been learning. 
- Advance my Python and R skills in a new context. 
- Find out how my Python and R skills complement one another.
- Gain some more experience with parallel and distributed computing using Amazon's [Elastic MapReduce (EMR)](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/) service. 
 - Think about problems in industry, which is something for which I have little experience.
- Engage with the Kaggle community to build up my skills in knowing the right angles to take with a new data problem, for which I might have little domain experience.  
- Meet other data scientists in the Greater Boston area. 

My first entry is going to be in [Titanic Survival](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) challenge. The goal of the challenge is to predict survival rates of passengers based on several features. I have a simple goal: to score a 80% to 82% accuracy in my model predictions. It's my understanding that anything above an 85% accuracy means you are cheating in this competition. As such, if you factor out everyone above that point, a score of 80% accuracy with my model would put me in the top 5% of the competition. Normally I would say that going for the top 5% in a competition that you have no experience with is a bit arrogant. However, I've seen people get in the 75-78% accuracy with some simple, but very clever, logistic regression models, so I think this is a feasible goal. 

These three books and this Coursea course have been key in helping me further my machine learning skills to the point of feeling confident enough to enter these competitions:
