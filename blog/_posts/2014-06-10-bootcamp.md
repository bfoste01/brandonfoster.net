#Integrated Scholarly Workflows
*(The estimated time to read this post is 1 minute)*

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find my blog useful for all sorts of purposes. This year I had the pleasure of participating in the Ph.D. student panel at the [Social Science Librarians Bootcamp, 2014](http://sites.tufts.edu/sslbc2014/speakers), held at the Harvard Business School of Innovation. The goal of the panel was to help librarians from across America better understand the tools that we use on the backend of our workflow to bring scholarship through to various stages of fruition. I participated in the panel representing the perspective of a data-heavy social science researcher. 

I have three blog posts in the pipeline to supplement the information I presented at the event that I will make available over the next 10 days:

1. [rmarkdown v2] (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com): Creating dynamic documents through integrating statistical analyses with prose using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com), [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
2. My Markdown workflow: tools I use to keep my writing completely portable. 
3. Powerpoint alternatives: I'll make the case for why you should ditch Powerpoint forever and embrace slide decks build with Markdown, HTML and Javascript. 

It is my hope that a variety people will find these posts useful, as many of these tools are easily adoptable into the workflows of professionals working within a business context. 

Until then you might want to take a second to check these out:
