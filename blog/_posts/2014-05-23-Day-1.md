*You will find:*

- How to guides for implementing R and Python (e.g., the Pandas package, iPython, and Python Notebook) into your data analysis work-flow.
- Fun opinionated pieces about statistics (i.e., I have a fun piece on the misunderstanding of p-values in the pipeline). 
- General thoughts about effective work-flows while in graduate school.
- Some documentation of my journey as a nascent web developer.
